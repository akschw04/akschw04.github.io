# Adria K Schwarber's personal website

This site contains my academic work in climate science and outreach efforts in science policy. 

This site is operated through the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) blogging system and is hosted by [GitHub](https://github.com). 
My current theme of choice is a tweaked version of the [zetsu theme](github.com/nandomoreirame/zetsu). 
All of the code for this website is publicly available in my [GitHub repository]({{ site.github }}).
