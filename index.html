										<h2>About</h2>
										<p>Science Policy Analyst with FYI Science Policy News at the American Institute of Physics</p>
									</header>
									<p>Dr. Adria K. Schwarber is a climate scientist working in science policy. She is currently an analyst 
									with FYI Science Policy News at the American Institute of Physics, where she reports on science policy 
									developments and creates actionable science policy resources for the community. <strong> Dedicated to 
									breaking down barriers to equal access to science and policy knowledge, Adria has endeavored to support 
									scientists of all ages in their learning and policy engagement goals.</strong> This passion has driven her 
									to discuss climate change science with general audiences, volunteer as an editor with the National Science 
									Policy Network, and judge local K-12 STEM fairs in underserved areas. <strong>In the future, Adria hopes to
									apply these skills to advance U.S. science diplomacy priorities with a focus on supporting climate change 
									agreements and building international scientific education and research capacity.</strong></p> 
									
									<p>Adria earned her Ph.D. in the <a href="https://www.atmos.umd.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic 
									Science </a> at the <a href="https://www.umd.edu/" target="_blank">Univeristy of Maryland, College Park</a> under the guidance 
									of Drs. Steven J. Smith and Corinne Hartin at the <a href="http://www.globalchange.umd.edu/" target="_blank">Joint Global Change 
									Research Institute</a>. <strong>Her research sought to clarify climate dynamics on shorter time scales
									using models of varying complexity—from complex models, which take several months
									to simulate 100 years of climate on a supercomputer, to simple climate models
									that can simulate the same period on a personal computer in less than a
									minute, in addition to using several observational datasets.</strong> At the University of Maryland, 
									Adria served as a Graduate Student Government Vice President, advancing 
									broad policy initiatives (e.g., serving on the Review of the Operations of The Graduate School Committee) 
									and more targeted endeavors 
									(e.g., serving on the Graduate Career Pathways Conference Committee).

									<p>Originally from Kentucky, Adria earned a dual B.A. in chemistry and political science from the University of Louisville in 2013. As an 
									undergradaute, she worked on inorganic synthesis of Moylbdinmum-Sulfur (Mo-S)complexes in the laboratory of Dr. Mark Noble. 
									<strong>Adria spent the summer of 2010 in Japan studying language and culture as a Gilman Scholar through the KIIS program. She returned to Japan for 
									an academic year (2010-2011) as a Boren Scholar at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University. Adria credits this time spent studying abroad in Japan with sparking her interest in science diplomacy.</strong></p>

										<h4>Dedication</h4>
										<p>I dedicated my dissertation to all the young girls and women aspiring to a career in 
										science. Pursuing science is challenging in many ways. Though you will expand your understanding of 
										the world around you, you will also face many adversities that are unfortunately ingrained in the 
										STEM education system. Without the mentors I have had throughout my career, including my 6th-grade 
										science teacher, Ms. Katy Drinkhouse, and my high-school science teachers, Sr. Mary-Ethel Parrott and 
										Sr. Judith Averbeck, I would not have pursued a STEM degree.</p>
										<p>I hope one day you will not face questions of the space you occupy or your abilities as a 
										scientist. Until then, I leave you with this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqOqo50LSZ0" target="_blank"> inspirational poem </a> by Maya Angelou. </p>

											<h4>Project 1: Evaluating Climate Emulation: Unit Testing of Simple Climate Models</h4>
											<p>Simple climate models (SCMs) are numerical representations of the Earth’s gas cycles and climate system. 
												SCMs are easy to use and computationally inexpensive, making them an ideal tool in both scientific and decision-making contexts 
												(e.g., complex climate model emulation; parameter estimation experiments; climate metric calculations; and probabilistic analyses). 
												Despite their prolific use, the fundamental responses of SCMs are often not directly characterized. In this study, we use unit tests of 
												three chemical species (CO2, CH4, and BC) to understand the fundamental gas cycle and climate system responses of several SCMs 
												(Hector v2.0, MAGICC 5.3, MAGICC 6.0, FAIR v1.0, and AR5-IR). We find that while idealized SCMs are widely used, they fail to capture 
												important global mean climate response features, which can produce biased temperature results. Comprehensive SCMs, which have non-linear 
												forcing and physically-based carbon cycle representations, show improved responses compared to idealized SCMs. Even some comprehensive SCMs 
												fail to capture response timescales of more complex models under BC or CO2 forcing perturbations. These results suggest where improvements
												should be made to SCMs. Further, we provide a set of fundamental tests that we recommend as a standard validation suite for any SCM. 
												Unit tests allow users to understand differences in model responses and the impact of model selection on results.

											<h4>Project 2: Characterization of Model Variability in CMIP5</h4>
											<p>Contributions from both unforced variability (e.g., ocean-atmosphere interactions) and external forcing (
												e.g., anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, volcanic activity, variations in solar intensity) drive changes in Earth’s 
												global mean surface temperature. Understanding the relative contributions from these different components is of great 
												interest to the scientific community (e.g., detection and attribution studies, time of emergence estimates). Though many 
												studies draw conclusions using estimates of, or assumptions about, unforced variability using multi-model ensembles, a 
												robust characterization of model-specific unforced model variability has not been conducted. We fill this gap by developing 
												a methodology to create model-specific unforced noise envelopes using complex model output from the Coupled Model 
												Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) experiments. From this, we can determine how realistic complex model variability is 
												compared to observations. We compare CMIP5 model results from the past1000 and PiControl experiments with two historical 
												observational datasets (GISTEMP, HadCRUT4) and paleoclimate reconstructions from PAGES2k. We first examine variability in 
												those CMIP5 models with sufficient data (e.g., published past1000 output and long PiControl runs) and apply our methodology 
												to extrapolate information for the majority of models with less available data. We use power spectra of temperature-time 
												series to compare variability across all time scales. Preliminary results suggest that observations have more variability 
												than the suite of CMIP5 models investigated. Additionally, we investigate model variability at the regional level, using 
												the sub-global regions defined by PAGES 2k. Our approach allows for a more robust assessment of complex model variability 
												at time periods and regional levels important to human systems. </p>

											<h4>Project 3: Changes in Climate Sensitivity over Time</h4>
											<p>The time scales of climate system responses to anthropogenic emissions vary
												depending on the chemical species emitted. Though carbon dioxide(CO2) emissions
												primarily drive anthropogenic climate change, emissions of various other radiative
												forcing agents, including short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs), also contribute signifcantly
												to Earth's altered radiative budget. Much of the literature focuses on long-term
												climate responses emphasizing analysis with equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS)
												or transient climate sensitivity (TCR). There is limited literature exploring shortterm
												climate change responses occurring in a 20-30 year time horizon. To address this gap, 
												we seek to clarify climate dynamics on decadal time scales with the
												ultimate goal of understanding the implications of near-term emission reductions
												on climate. Using observations and coupled model results from CMIP5, we analyze
												the range of temperature response over time, with specific attention to the 20-30
												year time sequence. Similarly, we also explore sub-global temperature responses
												at a hemispheric-scale. We find that the range of responses of land/ocean varied
												less than the range of hemispheric responses. Our results are a first step of better
												quantifying the short-term climate responses to change in SLCFs.</p>
