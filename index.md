# Short introduction

Adria K. Schwarber is a Ph.D. candidate in the Atmospheric and Oceanic Science Department at the University of Maryland, College Park. 
Here, she works with Dr. Steven J. Smith and Dr. Corinne Hartin at the Joint Global Change Research Institute (JGCRI) investigating the role 
short-lived climate forcers, like methane and black carbon, have in modifying climate in the near-term using climate models of varying 
complexity and observations. At the University of Maryland, Adria also served as a Graduate Student Government Vice President, advancing 
broad policy initiatives (e.g., serving on the Review of the Operations of The Graduate School Committee) and more targeted endeavors 
(e.g., serving on the Graduate Career Pathways Conference Committee). She is passionate about science communication and public engagement, 
having spoken at both the D.C. Story Collider and the Smithsonianâ€™s Earth Optimism Teen Event, and is a frequent local science fair judge. 
Originally from Kentucky, Adria earned a dual B.A. in chemistry and political science from the University of Louisville in 2013. As an 
undergradaute, she worked on inorganic synthesis of Moylbdinmum-Sulfur (Mo-S)complexes in the laboratory of Dr. Mark Noble. 
Adria spent the summer of 2010 in Japan studying language and culture as a Gilman Scholar through the KIIS program. She returned to Japan for 
an academic year (2010-2011) as a Boren Scholar at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University. In 2016, she earned her M.S. in Atmospheric and 
Oceanic Science from the University of Maryland. Her professional interests include K-12 STEM education, science communication, and science policy/diplomacy.
