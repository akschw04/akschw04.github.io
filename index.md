# Short introduction

Adria K. Schwarber earned her Ph.D. in the <a href="https://www.atmos.umd.edu/">Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Science </a> at the <a href="https://www.umd.edu/">Univeristy of Maryland, College Park</a> under the guidance of Drs. Steven J. Smith and Corinne Hartin at the <a href="http://www.globalchange.umd.edu/">Joint Global Change Research Institute</a>. Her research sought to clarify climate dynamics on shorter time scales
using models of varying complexity—from complex models, which take several months
to simulate 100 years of climate on a supercomputer, to simple climate models
(SCMs) that can simulate the same period on a personal computer in less than a
minute, in addition to using several observational datasets. At the University of Maryland, Adria served as a Graduate Student Government Vice President, advancing 
broad policy initiatives (e.g., serving on the Review of the Operations of The Graduate School Committee) and more targeted endeavors 
(e.g., serving on the Graduate Career Pathways Conference Committee). She is passionate about science communication and public engagement, 
having spoken at both the D.C. Story Collider and the Smithsonian’s Earth Optimism Teen Event, and is a frequent local science fair judge. 
Originally from Kentucky, Adria earned a dual B.A. in chemistry and political science from the University of Louisville in 2013. As an 
undergradaute, she worked on inorganic synthesis of Moylbdinmum-Sulfur (Mo-S)complexes in the laboratory of Dr. Mark Noble. 
Adria spent the summer of 2010 in Japan studying language and culture as a Gilman Scholar through the KIIS program. She returned to Japan for 
an academic year (2010-2011) as a Boren Scholar at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University. In 2016, she earned her M.S. in Atmospheric and 
Oceanic Science from the University of Maryland. Her professional interests include K-12 STEM education, science communication, and science policy/diplomacy.
