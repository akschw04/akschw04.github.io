# Evaluating Climate Emulation: Unit Testing of Simple Climate Models

Simple climate models (SCMs) underlie many important scientific and decision-making endeavors. 
This illustrates the need for their use to be rooted in a clear understanding of their fundamental responses. 
In this study, we provide a comprehensive assessment of model performance by evaluating the fundamental responses of 
several SCMs. We find biases in some responses, which have implication for decision science. We conclude by recommending 
a standard set of validation test for any SCM. 


# Characterization of Model Variability in CMIP5

Contributions from both unforced variability (e.g., ocean-atmosphere interactions) and external forcing (
e.g., anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, volcanic activity, variations in solar intensity) drive changes in Earthâ€™s 
global mean surface temperature. Understanding the relative contributions from these different components is of great 
interest to the scientific community (e.g., detection and attribution studies, time of emergence estimates). Though many 
studies draw conclusions using estimates of, or assumptions about, unforced variability using multi-model ensembles, a 
robust characterization of model-specific unforced model variability has not been conducted. We fill this gap by developing 
a methodology to create model-specific unforced noise envelopes using complex model output from the Coupled Model 
Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) experiments. From this, we can determine how realistic complex model variability is 
compared to observations. We compare CMIP5 model results from the past1000 and PiControl experiments with two historical 
observational datasets (GISTEMP, HadCRUT4) and paleoclimate reconstructions from PAGES2k. We first examine variability in 
those CMIP5 models with sufficient data (e.g., published past1000 output and long PiControl runs) and apply our methodology 
to extrapolate information for the majority of models with less available data. We use power spectra of temperature-time 
series to compare variability across all time scales. Preliminary results suggest that observations have more variability 
than the suite of CMIP5 models investigated. Additionally, we investigate model variability at the regional level, using 
the sub-global regions defined by PAGES 2k. Our approach allows for a more robust assessment of complex model variability 
at time periods and regional levels important to human systems.
